# 3D-MBTA-Subway-Tracker-Map
This Node.js app uses Google Maps WebGL Overlay View to render 3D markers representing MBTA subway/commuter cars, and is updated real-time, using server-sent events. This server is provisioned on EC2 and uses a Load Balancer and Auto Scaling to horizontally scale the number of instances as traffic spikes higher or lower.
